description: 'This project integrates language models with retrieval-augmented generation
  (RAG) and systems biology modeling to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data and simulate
  drug effects on eczema. It leverages the Ollama language model server for natural
  language processing and embedding generation, and combines two main components:
  a RAG model for querying gene expression data and a SysBio model for simulating
  drug effects using an Atopic Dermatitis Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (AD-QSP)
  model. The system is implemented as a user-friendly Streamlit application, allowing
  researchers and medical professionals to explore complex biological datasets, test
  drug efficacy hypotheses, and receive AI-generated insights on biomedical questions.'
